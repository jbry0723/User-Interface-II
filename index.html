        My career as a web developer:

    <section class="aboutme">
        <p>Hi, I'm Justin! I'm a Lambda student in Atlanta, Georgia currently learning full stack web development. I am hoping to use the skills I learn to build a career web marketing. I've learned a bit of HTML, Javascript, and CSS so far; with CSS being my favorite. My time at Lambda and extensive work experience have taught me the skills I need to work effectively with teams of web developers. These are experiences and skills I look forward to bringing to all future projects I work on.  Below are some of the projects I've worked on, feel free to ask me more about any of them!</p>
